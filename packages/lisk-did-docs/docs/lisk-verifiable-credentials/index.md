A library for working with [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and verifiable presentations (VP) using [Lisk DID method](https://github.com/aldhosutra/lisk-did/blob/main/packages/lisk-did-module/docs/did-method-spec.md)

## About Lisk

Lisk is an open-source blockchain application platform written in Javascript, designed to bridge the gap between accessibility and web3 adoption. Learn more about Lisk from their [official website](https://lisk.com), as well as it's public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LiskHQ).

## About `did:lisk` Method

`did:lisk` is a DID method specifically designed for Lisk sidechain, which outlines syntax, data model, and operations that adheres to W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Specification.

A `did:lisk` DID consist of a method, chainspace, namespace, and unique-id that suitable for specific, tailored, self-sovereign identity use case. An example of a `did:lisk` identifier, is as follows:

```abnf
did:lisk:enevti:address:lsk9gxy8ua2n5sj7eqvtp554hvce8m39sy39sjwzu
```

Please refer to the [did:lisk method spec](https://github.com/aldhosutra/lisk-did/blob/main/packages/lisk-did-module/docs/did-method-spec.md) draft for further explanation. As its still in under active development, community contribution will be much appreciated.

## Getting Started

### Sidechain Setup

Since this tool is tailored for Lisk-based sidechains, you need to start by setting up a blockchain client. You can find guidance on configuring your blockchain environment in the official [Lisk Documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/beta/build-blockchain/create-blockchain-client.html), as well as in [Lisk Discord #dev-chat channel](https://lisk.chat/)

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save @lisk-did/lisk-verifiable-credentials
```

### Usage

You can use this library to issue and verify a Verifiable Credentials (VC) using Lisk cryptography and Lisk DID, which use Ed25519 keys:

```typescript
import vc from '@lisk-did/lisk-verifiable-credentials';

async function vcExample() {
    // you can also use did.getAddressDIDFromPublicKey from @lisk-did/lisk-decentralized-identifier
    const issuer = 'did:lisk:enevti:address:lsk9gxy8ua2n5sj7eqvtp554hvce8m39sy39sjwzu';

    // the credentials needs to adheres to W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model
    const credential = {
		'@context': [
			'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1',
			'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1',
		],
		type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'UniversityDegreeCredential'],
		issuer: issuer,
		credentialSubject: {
			id: 'urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6', // => needs to be in URI format
			alumniOf: 'Harvard University'
		},
	};

    const privateKey = <your-private-key>;
    const signedVC = await vc.issueCredential(credential, privateKey, {ipc: '~/.lisk/enevti-core'});

    // later you can verify a signedVC as follows
    const verifyVC = await vc.verifyCredential(signedVC, publicKey, {ipc: '~/.lisk/enevti-core'});
    if (verifyVC.verified === true) {
        // vc is verified
        // do something
    }
}
```
