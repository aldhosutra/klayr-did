Lisk module which implements on-chain logic for Lisk decentralized identifiers (DIDs)

## About Lisk

Lisk is an open-source blockchain application platform written in Javascript, designed to bridge the gap between accessibility and web3 adoption. Learn more about Lisk from their [official website](https://lisk.com), as well as it's public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LiskHQ).

## About `did:lisk` Method

`did:lisk` is a DID method specifically designed for Lisk sidechain, which outlines syntax, data model, and operations that adheres to W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Specification.

A `did:lisk` DID consist of a method, chainspace, namespace, and unique-id that suitable for specific, tailored, self-sovereign identity use case. An example of a `did:lisk` identifier, is as follows:

```abnf
did:lisk:enevti:address:lsk9gxy8ua2n5sj7eqvtp554hvce8m39sy39sjwzu
```

Please refer to the [did:lisk method spec](https://github.com/aldhosutra/lisk-did/blob/main/packages/lisk-did-module/docs/did-method-spec.md) draft for further explanation. As its still in under active development, community contribution will be much appreciated.

## Module Architecture

## Getting Started

### Sidechain Setup

Since this tool is tailored for Lisk-based sidechains, you need to start by setting up a blockchain client. You can find guidance on configuring your blockchain environment in the official [Lisk Documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/beta/build-blockchain/create-blockchain-client.html), as well as in [Lisk Discord #dev-chat channel](https://lisk.chat/)

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save @lisk-did/lisk-did-module
```

### Module Configurations

Under your blockchain config folder, please specify required configurations for did module:

```json
{
  "<...other_config>": "",
  "modules": {
    "did": {
      "chainspace": "enevti",
      "autoCreateAddressDID": true
    },
    "<...other_modules>": ""
  }
}
```

Those configuration can be explained as follows:

1. **chainspace**: (REQUIRED) chainspace to be used by your chain's DID. `did:lisk` require a chainspace to be defined, as it's format is as follows: `did:lisk:{chainspace}:{namespace}:{unique-id}`
2. **autoCreateAddressDID**: (default to true) whether you want to enable auto address DID creation. If this option is enabled, an address DID will be automatically created when the address sends any transaction.

### Register Module

Last step is to register did module to your blockchain app. Add this code to `./src/app/modules.ts` as follows:

```typescript
import { DidModule } from '@lisk-did/lisk-did-module';

export const registerModules = (app: Application, method: LiskMethod): void => {
  // your other module registration
  app.registerModule(new DidModule()); // add this
};
```
