Lisk DID/VC Development Kit. `lisk-did` is an all-in-one package that provides you with tools to develop [W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) solutions for Lisk-based sidechains.

## About Lisk

Lisk is an open-source blockchain application platform written in Javascript, designed to bridge the gap between accessibility and web3 adoption. Learn more about Lisk from their [official website](https://lisk.com), as well as it's public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LiskHQ).

## About `did:lisk` Method

`did:lisk` is a DID method specifically designed for Lisk sidechain, which outlines syntax, data model, and operations that adheres to W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Specification.

A `did:lisk` DID consist of a method, chainspace, namespace, and unique-id that suitable for specific, tailored, self-sovereign identity use case. An example of a `did:lisk` identifier, is as follows:

```abnf
did:lisk:enevti:address:lsk9gxy8ua2n5sj7eqvtp554hvce8m39sy39sjwzu
```

Please refer to the [did:lisk method spec](https://github.com/aldhosutra/lisk-did/blob/main/packages/lisk-did-module/docs/did-method-spec.md) draft for further explanation. As its still in under active development, community contribution will be much appreciated.

## Getting Started

### Sidechain Setup

Since this tool is tailored for Lisk-based sidechains, you need to start by setting up a blockchain client. You can find guidance on configuring your blockchain environment in the official [Lisk Documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/beta/build-blockchain/create-blockchain-client.html), as well as in [Lisk Discord #dev-chat channel](https://lisk.chat/)

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save lisk-did
```
