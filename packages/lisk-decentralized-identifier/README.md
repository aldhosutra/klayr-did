A library to work with [W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) for Lisk sidechains with the [Lisk DID module](https://npmjs.com/package/@lisk-did/lisk-did-module)

## About Lisk

Lisk is an open-source blockchain application platform written in Javascript, designed to bridge the gap between accessibility and web3 adoption. Learn more about Lisk from their [official website](https://lisk.com), as well as it's public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LiskHQ).

## About `did:lisk` Method

`did:lisk` is a DID method specifically designed for Lisk sidechain, which outlines syntax, data model, and operations that adheres to W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Specification.

A `did:lisk` DID consist of a method, chainspace, namespace, and unique-id that suitable for specific, tailored, self-sovereign identity use case. An example of a `did:lisk` identifier, is as follows:

```abnf
did:lisk:enevti:address:lsk9gxy8ua2n5sj7eqvtp554hvce8m39sy39sjwzu
```

Please refer to the [did:lisk method spec](https://github.com/aldhosutra/lisk-did/blob/main/packages/lisk-did-module/docs/did-method-spec.md) draft for further explanation. As its still in under active development, community contribution will be much appreciated.

## Getting Started

### Sidechain Setup

Since this tool is tailored for Lisk-based sidechains, you need to start by setting up a blockchain client. You can find guidance on configuring your blockchain environment in the official [Lisk Documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/beta/build-blockchain/create-blockchain-client.html), as well as in [Lisk Discord #dev-chat channel](https://lisk.chat/)

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save @lisk-did/lisk-decentralized-identifier
```

### Usage

You can use this library to retrive on-chain DID Document data, and authorize whether a key is valid within DID document:

```typescript
import did from '@lisk-did/lisk-decentralized-identifier';
import {cryptography} from 'lisk-sdk';

async function didExample() {
    // get DID document from a sidechain node
    const didDocument = await did.getDIDDocument('did:lisk:enevti:address:lsk9gxy8ua2n5sj7eqvtp554hvce8m39sy39sjwzu', {ipc: '~/.lisk/enevti-core'});

    // authorize a publicKey from a DID document
    const privateKey = <your-private-key>
    const publicKey = cryptography.ed.getPublicKeyFromPrivateKey(privateKey);
    const relationships = await did.cryptography.method.getVerificationRelationship(didDocument, {publicKey: myPublicKey});

    if (relationships.length > 0) {
        // key is authorized
        // do something
    }
}
```
